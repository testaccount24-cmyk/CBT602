In order for the LSPCR exec to work, you need to have the load module
for LSPACE (alias LSPC) installed.  Source code for this program can
be found on the CBT Tape collection, File 136.  A load library in
XMIT format for the LSPC TSO command, is conveniently placed in this
file, as member LSPC.

In order to create the load library which contains the LSPACE TSO
command, which can then be copied to the TSO-accessible load library
of your choice, you need merely execute a TSO RECEIVE command against
the LSPC member of this pds, as follows:

    RECEIVE INDS(userid.FILE602.PDS(LSPC))

and answer the prompts by pressing enter, or overriding with the
DSN(new.dsname) or VOL(yourvl) parameters.

By default, the new load library name will be:  yourid.LSPACE.LOADLIB
and will contain members LSPACE and its alias LSPC.
