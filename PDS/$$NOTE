Mr. Golob:

The attached .ZIP file contains a binary TSO TRANSMIT format
file, and this TSO file contains a couple of REXX execs and their
associated ISPF panels and documentation.

The two REXX execs are called PUT and LSPCR.

PUT is an edit macro which lets you PUT lines from a dataset or
pds member that you are edting into another dataset or PDS
member. I used to do a lot of work on VM/CMS, and made good use
of the CMS PUT command, so I decided to create a version for
ISPF.

LSPCR is a REXX exec that executes the TSO LSPACE command and
displays the output in a scrollable panel. You can sort the panel
display on one of several fields. The scrollable panel is a lot
easier to read than the output from the TSO command.

Thank you,
