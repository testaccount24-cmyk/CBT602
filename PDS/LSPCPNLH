+LSPCR is a full-screen ISPF version of the LSPC (LSPACE) TSO command.
+You can specify full or partial VOLSERs, or unit addresses, device
+names (3330, 2314, etc.), or mount status (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, STORAGE).
+You cannot specify the FLAGS parameter.
+
+If you specify a parameter of 'ABC' you will only see those volumes
+that begin with the letters ABC. Enter DEF to see all the DEF volumes,
+etc. If you enter the LSCPR command with no parameters you will see all
+available volumes.
+
+You can enter more than one volume parameter at a time. If you enter
+TSO LSPCR ABC DEF GHI you will see all volumes beginning with those
+three sets of letters. You may enter up to six volume parameters at a
+time. You can mix full VOLSERs and partial VOLSERS. You mix VOLSERs
+with ucb addresses, device names, or mount status, such as:
+
+TSO LSPCR ABC 3380 PRIVATE
+
+If any volume fits into more than one group it will be listed once for
+each group. If a PRIVATE volume is also a 3380 volume it would be
+listed twice in the above example.
+
+Any values that are in the VOLUMES line at the time you end the exec
+will be recalled and used as the start up parameters the next time you
+use the exec if you enter the LSPCR command by itself without any
+parms.
+
+If you enter the LSPCR command with parameters then those will be used
+instead of the previous parms.
+
+The volume display is initially sorted by two fields. First it is
+sorted in ascending order by the first three letters of the volume
+serial. So if you entered TSO LSPCR ABC DEF GHI, the ABC volumes would
+appear first, then the DEF, then the GHI volumes.
+
+The display is then sorted in descending order by free space. Within a
+group, volumes with the most free space will be first, followed by the
+volume with the next highest amount of free space, etc.
+
+On the LSPCR panel, The input line labelled VOLUMES is where you can
+enter different VOLSERS, ucb addresses, etc. Just separate each one
+with a space. Just like on the initial command, you can enter up to six
+fields at one time.
+
+LSPCR supports one primary command, which is SORT. You can sort the
+display in either ascending or descending order by various fields. The
+fields that you can sort on are VOLSER, Free Cyls, Free Trks, Free
+Extents, Contiguous Free Cyls, and Contiguous Free Trks.
+
+To sort the display, enter the SORT command followed by a number and a
+letter.  The number must be a whole number from 1 to 6. 1 is Volser, 2
+is Free Cyls, etc. The sort field numbers are displayed below the field
+names for clarity. The letter must be either A for ascending order or
+D for descending order. If you do not enter the sort order it will
+default to A.
+
+Once you enter a SORT command the fields will always be sorted that way
+until you enter a new sort command. The sort order remains the same
+even between different invocations of the command. If you sort the
+display in ascending order by VOLSER, that's the way the display will
+be sorted the next time you execute LSPCR. To change the sort order
+just enter a new sort command.
+
+To exit LSPCR just press the PF3 key.
